<ul>

<li>2018-06-11: 0.6.2
  <ul>
    <li>Updated to work with newer Net::DNS versions</li>
    <li>Better regexp to match IPv4 octets</li>
    <li>Code cleanup (better separation of host and class handling functions)</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>2000-09-23: 0.6.1
  <ul>
    <li>Increased performance on recursive operation. Now classes are only checked if the host lookup fails (based on a patch by James H. Thompson)</li>
    <li>New "-p" or "--progress" command line option. This will print a dot for each line that is resolved, showing the status of the resolve process</li>
    <li>Fixed the "oops" assertion bug introduced in 0.6.0</li>
    <li>Code cleanup (better separation of host and class handling functions)</li>
    <li>Now searches the full Perl @INC path for Net::DNS</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>2000-06-17: 0.6.0
  <ul>
    <li>Improved performance (lines/s) and less cpu usage</li>
    <li>Better line caching algorithm</li>
    <li>Reduced memory footprint</li>
    <li>The code is now fully commented</li>
    <li>A new ./configure script (locates Perl, Net::DNS, etc)</li>
    <li>Now supports virtually any log format, and many IPs per line (thanks Gary)</li>
    <li>More internal debugging messages</li>
    <li>Class octects are not inverted anymore in the database, and also shows how the entry was resolved and at what time (WARNING: this means the database format has changed)</li>
    <li>Doesn't abort anymore if a machine runs out of sockets (will continue processing and wait for free sockets)</li>
    <li>Added the "--dbfirst" and "dbonly" options to check the database before sending DNS queries or not to send queries at all</li>
    <li>Now uses NS queries for recursion (instead of SOA) (suggested by Gary)</li>
    <li>Integrated the "--dumpdb", "--mergedb" and "--unresolved" options and killed the corresponding external programs</li>
    <li>Added option "--expiredb=&lt;hours&gt;" to expire database entries older than &lt;hours&gt; hours</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-08-26: 0.5.2
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed memory leak when the --database option was not in use</li>
    <li>Fixed warning messages when the --recursive option was not in use</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-08-16: 0.5.1
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed warning messages on FreeBSD</li>
    <li>Format of jdresolve-dumpdb dumps have changed. Now classes are dumped in truncated IP format (not in-addr.arpa format as before)</li>
    <li>Added jdresolve-mergedb and jdresolve-unresolved utils</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-07-27: 0.5
  <ul>
    <li>Added database support. Tested DB_File, but any db variant (dbm, gdbm, sdbm, etc) should work. The main purpose of this option is to offer fallback in case DNS servers are down and allow a general performace increase by allowing you to lower your timeout value without sacrificing resolved percentage</li>
    <li>New support program "jdresolve-dumpdb" to dump the databases created with the "--database" switch</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-07-14: 0.4
  <ul>
    <li>Changed name to jdresolve not to cause confusion with other projects</li>
    <li>GNU compliance changes: added long command line options thru Getopts::Long, no warranties warning, copyright notice</li>
    <li>Fixed a division by zero bug with statistics (thanks to John Croft and Andrezj Tobola for pointing this out)</li>
    <li>Made available RPM and SRPM packages for jdresolve and Net::DNS</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-07-09: 0.3
  <ul>
    <li>Totally redesigned main loop algorithm</li>
    <li>Now supports _huge_ log files (low memory usage)</li>
    <li>Input from STDIN if file is '-' since we only need 1 pass now</li>
    <li>New "-l" switch to control memory line caching</li>
    <li>Quick script 'rhost' to resolve single hosts with recursion</li>
    <li>Added more statistics (total time, lines/s, etc)</li>
    <li>No more warnings with Perl 5.004_04</li>
    <li>Code cleanup, now uses a more modular approach</li>
    <li>Updated documentation</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-07-02: 0.2
  <ul>
    <li>Added debug levels 1 and 2</li>
    <li>Only warns about invalid/resolved IPs if debug level &gt;= 2</li>
    <li>You can now run logresolve.pl on partly/fully resolved logs with no warning messages</li>
    <li>Added statistics at end of run</li>
    <li>New option -n to supress statistics</li>
    <li>New option -m to specify a custom mask to apply to IPs resolved by recurrence. accepts %i for IP and %c for class name</li>
    <li>Packaged as a .tar.gz file with COPYING, INSTALL, README, CREDITS, CHANGELOG and logresolve.pl files. Documentation is a Good Thing.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>1999-06-29: 0.1
  <ul>
    <li>Initial release
  </ul>
