   PREREQUISITES
     * A decent Perl distribution (IO::Select, etc). Tested with Perl
       5.005_03, 5.004m7 and 5.004_04, all run without warnings
     * The Net::DNS module

   USING DEBIAN

   This couldn't be easier:

     apt-get install jdresolve

   No need to download anything by hand, as jdresolve is now a Debian app.
   That'll install any dependencies too :) Debian kicks ass.

   USING THE RPM PACKAGES (RedHat, Mandrake, etc)

   Just use the following commands:

     rpm -Uvh perl-Net-DNS-0.12-1.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh
     jdresolve-0.6.1-1.noarch.rpm

   USING THE .TAR.GZ OR .TAR.BZ2 PACKAGES (Any distro)

   To install the Net::DNS module, fetch it from a CPAN mirror
   (http://www.cpan.org), or use the CPAN module to do it automagically.

   Using the CPAN modules is simple. You can run it from the command line
   or interactively:
     * command line: perl -MCPAN -e "command"
     * interactive: perl -MCPAN -e shell

   To keep you Perl distribution updated, you should issue command like
   "install Bundle::CPAN" regularly. Here is some sample output:
   [root@xhost /root]# perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::CPAN"
   CPAN: LWP::UserAgent loaded ok
   Fetching with LWP:
     ftp://cpan.if.usp.br/pub/mirror/CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
   Going to read /root/.cpan/sources/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz
   CPAN: Compress::Zlib loaded ok
   Going to read /root/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz
   Scanning cache /root/.cpan/build for sizes
   Fetching with LWP:

   Going to read /root/.cpan/sources/modules/03modlist.data.gz
   MD5 is up to date.
   File::Spec is up to date.
   Compress::Zlib is up to date.
   Archive::Tar is up to date.
   Data::Dumper is up to date.
   Net::Telnet is up to date.
   Net::Cmd is up to date.
   Term::ReadKey is up to date.
   Term::ReadLine::Perl is up to date.
   CPAN::WAIT is up to date.
   CPAN is up to date.

   So for jdresolve to work, you should at least issue an "install
   Net::DNS".

   After that just go back to where you unpacked jdresolve and run
   './configure' and then 'make install' as root.
