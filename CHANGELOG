     * 2000-09-23: 0.6.1
          + Increased performance on recursive operation. Now classes are
            only checked if the host lookup fails (based on a patch by
            James H. Thompson)
          + New "-p" or "--progress" command line option. This will print
            a dot for each line that is resolved, showing the status of
            the resolve process
          + Fixed the "oops" assertion bug introduced in 0.6.0
          + Code cleanup (better separation of host and class handling
            functions)
          + Now searches the full Perl @INC path for Net::DNS
     * 2000-06-17: 0.6.0
          + Improved performance (lines/s) and less cpu usage
          + Better line caching algorithm
          + Reduced memory footprint
          + The code is now fully commented
          + A new ./configure script (locates Perl, Net::DNS, etc)
          + Now supports virtually any log format, and many IPs per line
            (thanks Gary)
          + More internal debugging messages
          + Class octects are not inverted anymore in the database, and
            also shows how the entry was resolved and at what time
            (WARNING: this means the database format has changed)
          + Doesn't abort anymore if a machine runs out of sockets (will
            continue processing and wait for free sockets)
          + Added the "--dbfirst" and "dbonly" options to check the
            database before sending DNS queries or not to send queries at
            all
          + Now uses NS queries for recursion (instead of SOA) (suggested
            by Gary)
          + Integrated the "--dumpdb", "--mergedb" and "--unresolved"
            options and killed the corresponding external programs
          + Added option "--expiredb=<hours>" to expire database entries
            older than <hours> hours
     * 1999-08-26: 0.5.2
          + Fixed memory leak when the --database option was not in use
          + Fixed warning messages when the --recursive option was not in
            use
     * 1999-08-16: 0.5.1
          + Fixed warning messages on FreeBSD
          + Format of jdresolve-dumpdb dumps have changed. Now classes
            are dumped in truncated IP format (not in-addr.arpa format as
            before)
          + Added jdresolve-mergedb and jdresolve-unresolved utils
     * 1999-07-27: 0.5
          + Added database support. Tested DB_File, but any db variant
            (dbm, gdbm, sdbm, etc) should work. The main purpose of this
            option is to offer fallback in case DNS servers are down and
            allow a general performace increase by allowing you to lower
            your timeout value without sacrificing resolved percentage
          + New support program "jdresolve-dumpdb" to dump the databases
            created with the "--database" switch
     * 1999-07-14: 0.4
          + Changed name to jdresolve not to cause confusion with other
            projects
          + GNU compliance changes: added long command line options thru
            Getopts::Long, no warranties warning, copyright notice
          + Fixed a division by zero bug with statistics (thanks to John
            Croft and Andrezj Tobola for pointing this out)
          + Made available RPM and SRPM packages for jdresolve and
            Net::DNS
     * 1999-07-09: 0.3
          + Totally redesigned main loop algorithm
          + Now supports _huge_ log files (low memory usage)
          + Input from STDIN if file is '-' since we only need 1 pass now
          + New "-l" switch to control memory line caching
          + Quick script 'rhost' to resolve single hosts with recursion
          + Added more statistics (total time, lines/s, etc)
          + No more warnings with Perl 5.004_04
          + Code cleanup, now uses a more modular approach
          + Updated documentation
     * 1999-07-02: 0.2
          + Added debug levels 1 and 2
          + Only warns about invalid/resolved IPs if debug level >= 2
          + You can now run logresolve.pl on partly/fully resolved logs
            with no warning messages
          + Added statistics at end of run
          + New option -n to supress statistics
          + New option -m to specify a custom mask to apply to IPs
            resolved by recurrence. accepts %i for IP and %c for class
            name
          + Packaged as a .tar.gz file with COPYING, INSTALL, README,
            CREDITS, CHANGELOG and logresolve.pl files. Documentation is
            a Good Thing.
     * 1999-06-29: 0.1
          + Initial release
